## Goals of users:

# UX
## Ideal User
### Users visiting my website would be:

*   From anyone in the Netherlands
*   Food lovers
*   Anyone who wants to get catering service for any event.
*   English speaking

### Why this website is a great solution:
In the Netherlands, there are very few good catering services for indian cuisine along with other cuisine so this website will fulfill a great variety of peoples food demand. In this current locked down situation , home delivery of good food is very demandable for a lot of people.

# Design Choices
## Overall Inspiration:
[This blog post](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-website-designs-list) inspired a number of my style choices while creating the website.
## Wireframes
I did not use any tool like Balsamiq in order to create my wireframe because I never used it before and I tried to learn but it cost me a lot of time for this reason initially I have made a structure of my website by pen and paper.
I prodcued some snapshot of that wireframe images of the idea that I drew on my paper for desktop,mobile and tablet version. 
The reason that this wireframe is vey concise is that my initial thoughts were not so broad and I have developed my thoughts after started coding and that's why my wireframe design is not very similar to my end project.

# Features

* Upon arrival to the website the user is greeted with a [hero image](assets/images/indexpage.PNG) of prepring food with a message which gives the idea of the website at a first glance .
* Along with the image, the vibrant color of the page and the logo at the right side of the nav bar is really eyecatching. 
* At the left side there is a button for [request qoute](assets/images/indexpage.PNG) so that user can request for their desired food or catering service very easily.

# Deployment
I developed this project in [GitPod IDE](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/), where I would commit to Git, and then push to GitHub via using the terminal in GitPod. I deployed this [Github repository](https://github.com/SabihaAfroze/Milestone-project1) to GitHub Pages via the following process:

1.  Logged into GitHub
2.  Under the tab 'Repositories', I selected **Milestone-project1**
3.  Subsequently I selected '**Settings**' from the menu at the top of the page
4.  I scrolled down the page top the **GitHub Pages** section
5.  On the dropdown bar under '**Source**', I selected '**master branch**'
6.  Once I selected 'master branch' the page reloaded, and the website was deployed
7.  I scrolled down the page again to find the **link** to the deployed website within a green highlighted area of the GitHub pages section, where this section also notified me that my website is deployed

The master branch was the only branch used for this website.
